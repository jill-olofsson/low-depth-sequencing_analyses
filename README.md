# low-depth-sequencing_analyses

This is a collection of scripts which take low depth secuencing data and bioinformatically call SNPs using a combination of genotype calling algorithms and allelic counts from aligned reads.

If using please cite one of the following:
Olofsson et al (2019) Phylogenomics using low-depth whole genome sequencing: a case study with the olive tribe, Mol Ecol Res, in revision.

Dunning et al (2017) The recent and rapid spread of Themeda triandra, Bot Lett, 164, 327-337.

Olofsson et al (2016) Genome biogeography reveals the intraspecific spread of adaptive mutations for a complex trait, Mol Ecol, 25, 6107-6123.
